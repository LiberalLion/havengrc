# Because postgrest uses the role of the user when determining
# how much of the API to show, we need to make the anon role 
# have elevated permissions,
# even though we definitely don't want to allow this in production.
# track https://github.com/begriffs/postgrest/issues/954 to see if this changes
# a possible way to handle this would be to embed the swagger viewing inside
# our webapp and find a way to give the swagger requests the JWT from the logged
# in user rather than being anonymous.
