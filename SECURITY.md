## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We support responsible disclosure. Please send reports to support@kindlyops.com

As a small project, we do not have the funding to provide guaranteed response times,
but do our best to respond promptly. We do not have a bug bounty program and are
unable to offer monetary rewards for finding vulnerabilities.
